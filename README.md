# stackoverflow_survey_ds_project

# Introduction 
In this project, we study the responses from the 2017 stackoverflow survey. The survey asks people a diverse range of topics related to their jobs, hobbies, values, and demographic information.

# Questions
We propose three questions and aim to answer them by exploring the dataset. 
* What are the most popular software developing platforms (IDE, version control system, etc)?
* What aspects do people pay attention to when looking for a job?
* Can we predict people's satisfaction with their jobs?

# Method
We explore the datasets using libaries including `pandas`, `seaborn`, and `matplotlib`. When predicting people's job satisfaction, we use the `sklearn` machine learning library. The analysis is performed with jupyter notebook. 

# Results
We find that 
* Git and Visual Studio are people's favorite platforms;
* Senior developers would consider life qualify factors such as compensation and commute time when applying for a job, while junior developers pay more attention to career-related factors such as personal development opportunities and product impact.
* We reach a 70% accuracy in predicting job satisfaction using logistic regression. The most important features are very interesting and is summarized in my blog (see below).
